# Silent Temperature Controller

This is a heating temperature controller intended to minimize the vibrations caused by the heating element.  It uses kHz speed PWM modulated DC, rather than switching 50 or 60 cycle mains power, to power the heating elements.  For explosing holographic emulsions, the temperature must be stable and the vibrations must be minimized so that the sub-wavelength interference features are preserved.  By using high frequency PWM, the mechanical vibration or magnetostriction of the heating element coils is raised above a likely resonance frequency and therefore unlikely to cause significant vibrational movement.

The temperature controller can use up to three B3950 10k nominal resistance thermistors, or alternatively a LM335 temperature-based zener diode.  Reference thermistors may be added so that differential measurements can be taken to compensate for component temperature drift.  The controller supports up to four heating elements.  The DC power supply is up to 24 volts and 10 amps or so, with the limitation given by the trace width on the PCB.  If additional power bus wires are soldered in parallel with the traces, a higher current capacity is likely possible.  It is best to place the thermistors and heating elements in a vibration isolated, thermally insulated enclosure in which the hologram is exposed, with the enclosure being small enough so that the heaters can maintain a constant temperature throughout the volume.  A vibration-isolated platform may be achieved by placing a heavy cement slab or granite slab on partially inflated tires, and the granite slab may be made part of a thermally insulated enclosure using polystryrene slabs as walls.
